#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the development, operation, and maintenance of software systems. It involves designing, coding, testing, and deploying software to meet user needs efficiently and reliably. As the foundation of the technology industry, software engineering ensures that applications and systems function correctly, securely, and at scale.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Software Engineering (1968) – The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference, highlighting the need for structured development methodologies.

The Advent of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s) – The rise of object-oriented programming (OOP) with languages like C++ and Java improved code reusability, maintainability, and modular design.

Agile Manifesto (2001) – The introduction of Agile methodologies revolutionized software development by emphasizing collaboration, flexibility, and iterative improvements.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Analysis – Gathering and defining system requirements.

Planning – Defining project scope, timelines, and resources.

Design – Creating system architecture and UI/UX layouts.

Implementation (Coding) – Writing and developing the software.

Testing – Identifying and fixing defects.

Deployment – Releasing the software to users.

Maintenance – Updating and optimizing the software after release.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
A linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.

Pros: Clear structure, well-documented, easy to manage.

Cons: Inflexible, difficult to incorporate changes.

Best Use Cases: Government projects, safety-critical systems (e.g., medical software).
Agile Methodology

An iterative, flexible approach that encourages collaboration and continuous improvement.

Pros: Adaptable to changes, faster delivery, continuous feedback.

Cons: Requires close collaboration, may lack detailed documentation.

Best Use Cases: Startups, dynamic projects (e.g., mobile app development).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Writes, tests, and maintains code to build software applications.

Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software meets quality standards through testing and bug identification.

Project Manager: Oversees project planning, execution, and communication among team members.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs enhance software development by providing tools for coding, debugging, and testing. Examples include:

Visual Studio Code (lightweight, extensible)

JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA (Java development)

Eclipse (open-source, versatile)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Debugging Complex Issues – Strategy: Use systematic debugging tools and logs.

Meeting Deadlines – Strategy: Use Agile planning and realistic time estimations.

Keeping Up with Technology – Strategy: Engage in continuous learning and professional development.

Collaboration with Teams – Strategy: Use communication tools and best practices in documentation.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing – Tests individual components or functions.

Integration Testing – Ensures different modules work together.

System Testing – Verifies the entire system functions as expected.

Acceptance Testing – Confirms the system meets user requirements before release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective input prompts to optimize responses from AI models. It plays a crucial role in getting accurate, relevant, and useful outputs from AI systems, such as ChatGPT.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:

"Tell me about Python."

Improved Prompt:

"Explain the key features of Python as a programming language, including its advantages and common use cases in data science and web development
